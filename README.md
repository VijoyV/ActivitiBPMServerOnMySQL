# ActivitiBPMServerOnMySQL

This is a Activiti Spring Boot Application with embedded Tomcat Servlet Container talking to MySQL DB

## Pre-requisite

Should have a MySQL Server 5.6 running with an empty Database 'activiti'. This should be accessed by a db user called 'activiti' and password 'acti$viti'.

Download the source code to Eclipse or Spring Tool Suite (STS) as a maven project or add a maven behaviour. Then build so that all required dependencies will be downloaded.

You may build this as satndalone jar file and run on any machine with Jaava 8 JRE installed, as a Standalone Application. Assume that the above mentioned MySQL server and database is up and running. Tomcat listening Http Port is 9090. 

## REST Endpoints

Your client applications (or REST Plug-Ins like POSTMAN ) may interact with this Activiti BPM Server (running stand-alone server) via REST. Use admin/admin as request sending client userid/password with Base64 Authentication in Http Header. 
The following custom and activiti supplied REST URLs are explained below to build a client application by you. 


### 1. To see the deployed process definitions - The Blue Print


>> GET http://localhost:9090/repository/process-definitions

>> GET http://localhost:9090/repository/process-definitions?key=DataMappingApprovalProcess


### 2. To create a user in a group 

>> POST http://localhost:9090/createUserInGroup

**NOTE:**
1. By this REST Call, the process will be started and first task will be submitted as well. And the state move to 'Approve' state
2. **dataMappingId** is **client system generated** and passed in as a json parameter. Activiti stores it as a process variable and one could get this id back from Activiti in subsequent requests.

### 5. To verify some status/states/diagrams from running Activiti Engine.

>> GET http://localhost:9090/runtime/tasks
>> GET http://localhost:9090/runtime/process-instances/{id}/diagram
>> GET http://localhost:9090/runtime/process-instances/{id}/variables
>> GET http://localhost:9090/runtime/tasks/{id}/variables


### 6. To claim a Task by logged in User

>> POST http://localhost:9090/claimTask
